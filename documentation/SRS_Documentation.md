# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the requirements for the Employee Management System. The system is designed to help organizations manage employee records, job roles, attendance, payroll, and related administrative tasks efficiently using a menu-driven interface and file-based data storage.

### 1.2 Scope
The Employee Management System provides functionalities for Admin and HR users to manage employee information, job roles, attendance, payroll, and reporting. The system ensures data integrity, security, and usability, and is intended for use on Linux-based environments with a standard C compiler.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **Admin:** User with full access to all system features, including employee and salary management.
- **HR:** User with access to attendance tracking and reporting features.
- **Payroll:** The process of calculating and distributing employee salaries.
- **SRS:** Software Requirements Specification.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Employee Management System is a standalone application developed in C, using file handling for persistent data storage. It features a menu-driven interface for ease of use.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Employee record management (add, update, delete, view)
- Job role management
- Attendance tracking and history
- Payroll calculation and processing
- Salary structure management
- Data storage and retrieval
- User authentication and role-based access
- Reporting and viewing summaries
- Data backup and restore
- Audit logging
- Search and filter
- Export/print reports

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Admin:** Manages employee records, job roles, salary structures, and has access to all system features.
- **HR:** Manages attendance, views reports, and has limited access compared to Admin.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Linux-based operating system
- Standard C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- All data must be stored and managed using file handling techniques.
- The system must be menu-driven and user-friendly.

### 2.6 User Documentation
- User manual (to be provided)
- In-application help and error messages
